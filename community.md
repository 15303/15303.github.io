    On November 13, 2019, several team members, along with coach Simon, once again presented at a science fair at Arroyo Vista Elementary School of South Pasadena,           covering the fundamentals of FTC and along with the teamâ€™s history and the improvements we made.

  <p>
    The team was officially created at the FTC 2019 kickoff event in Moreno Valley High School on September 8, 2018. We quickly learned how to work with REV parts and made initial designs. The team also changed in size as some members joined while other members left. Later, the team was able to advance more as we entered into our second year. With the new-gained knowledge and one year of experience, we were able to do better than the previous year and experiment with two robots.

<h2>Future Plans</h2>
 <p>
          In the future, our team plans to learn Android Studio, Java, 3D modeling, and 3D printing. As COVID-19 is going on, we also hope to be able to have in-                  person meetings while strictly following the quarantine measures.
