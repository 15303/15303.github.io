    <h1>History</h1>


<p>Team Space Rocks was started by coach Simon Pei in September of 2018, along with his two children and three other members. From 2018-2020, team members met at coach Simon’s house weekly to design and build the robot. Each member was assigned specific roles and held important roles in the team. </p>
    
 <h2> Competitons </h2>
 <h3> 2018 - 2019 </h3>
 <p> Our robot competed in all of the League meets, allowing the team to gain lots of experience, make numerous modifications, and develop better strategies. Since the initial design, we’ve made many changes to the robot. In the end, the improvements helped Team Rocks to rank 4th overall. </p>
 <h3>2019-2020</h3>
<p>
Our robot continued to compete 
in all of the League meets, using past knowledge along with newly gained information to develop better strategies. Many changes were done to the robot after the initial design was established. With these new improvements, Team Space Rocks was able to frequently get top 5’s in competitions. Moreover, as only a second-year robotic team, we were able to win the LA Interleague tournament as the first alliance’s first pick.
