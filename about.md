# We are a youth robotics team based in Southern California. {#about}
Created in August 2018 as part of MajorStem.org, our team consists of a group of nine members who are not only passionate towards science, but also eager to develop skills in communication, collaboration, teamwork, and leadership. Every year we participate in the FIRST Tech Challenge, a nationwide robotics challenge where teams of middle and high school students compete to design, build, and program machines that score points in the challenge's game.

# Our FTC robot is built using the REV Robotics Kit and parts we made in-house.< {#robot}
Through the combination of 3D modeling and printing, as well as cutting, we are able to rapidly build and prototype innovative designs for our robot. For our mecanum wheel drivetrain, we rely on REV motors, controllers and extrusions. Our robot is currently in the works! Check back later for updates! Our code is hosted [on GitHub](https://github.com/15303/UltimateGoal).

# We post regular updates on our blog. {#social}
Coming soon.

Our robotics team is a part of FIRST Tech Challenge, a robotics competition that has challenges that rotate on a yearly basis. Check out their page [here!](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc) 
Here are some of our teams' ideas for this year.
