<h3>2019-2020</h3>
   
Our robot continued to compete 
in all of the League meets, using past knowledge along with newly gained information to develop better strategies. Many changes were done to the robot after the         initial design was established. With these new improvements, Team Space Rocks was able to frequently get top 5’s in competitions. Moreover, as only a second-year         robotics team, we were able to win the LA Interleague tournament as the first alliance’s first pick.
