<a href='#about'><h1 id='about'>We are a youth robotics team based in Southern California.</h1></a>
<p>Created in August 2018 as part of MajorStem.org, our team consists of a group of nine members who are not only passionate towards science, but also eager to develop skills in communication, collaboration, teamwork, and leadership.</p>
<p>Every year we participate in the FIRST Tech Challenge, a nationwide robotics challenge where teams of middle and high school students compete to design, build, and program machines that score points in the challenge's game.</p>

<a href='#robot'><h1 id='robot'>Our FTC robot is built using the REV Robotics Kit and parts we made in-house.</h1></a>
<p>Through the combination of 3D modeling and printing, as well as cutting, we are able to rapidly build and prototype innovative designs for our robot.</p>
<p>For our mecanum wheel drivetrain, we rely on REV motors, controllers and extrusions.</p>
<p>Our robot is currently in the works! Check back later for updates!</p>
